### Features

- **Scraper Service**: In addition to the API, a scraper service is employed to extract content from various sources, ensuring that users receive comprehensive news coverage.
- **Cache Service**: To enhance performance and reduce loading times, a caching service is implemented. This allows the app to store previously fetched news articles and serve them quickly when needed.
